            window.URL.revokeObjectURL(downloadUrl);
            showToast('success', 'Excel file downloaded successfully');
        })
        .catch(() => showToast('error', 'Failed to export'));
}
```

**HTML Change:**

    { field: 'customer', operator: 'equals', value: 'ABC Corp' }, // AND
    { field: 'pol', operator: 'equals', value: 'Los Angeles' }    // AND
  ],
  [ // OR Group 2  
    { field: 'carrier', operator: 'contains', value: 'Maersk' }
  ]
]
```

**Buttons:**
- "+ AND Condition" - Add condition within current group

  "assignTo": "",
  "isActive": true
}
```

**Model Updated:**
```php
protected $fillable = [
    'module', 'title', 'description', 'config', 'order', 'is_active'
];

protected $casts = [
    'config' => 'array',
    'is_active' => 'boolean',
    'order' => 'integer'
];
```

**STATUS**: ✅ **COMPLETE - FULLY INTEGRATED**

### User Request:
"is module ma say jo invoice generate hogi os ma dynamic data jaega is view ka har tab say relevant inputs ma say"

**Translation**: "When invoice is generated in a module, dynamic data from the relevant Shipment Memo Auto-Load configuration should populate the invoice fields."

### What Was Implemented:

#### Complete Integration Architecture:

**Flow:**
```
Settings → Shipment Memo Auto-Load (Configuration)
    ↓ (User checks fields: Shipper, Consignee, Agent, etc.)
    ↓ (Saves to database: shipment_memo_configs table)
    ↓
Module → Generate Freight Invoice (Button clicked)
    ↓ (Reads configuration from database)
    ↓ (Extracts enabled field values from shipment)
    ↓
Invoice Generated with Auto-Populated Fields
```

#### Files Created:

1. **`app/Services/ShipmentMemoAutoPopulationService.php`** (NEW - 300+ lines)
   - Core service handling all auto-population logic
   - Field mappings for all 6 modules
   - Intelligent data extraction with fallbacks
   
**Key Methods:**
- `getAutoPopulatedData($module, $shipment, $section)` - Extract field values
- `getEnabledFields($module, $section)` - Get enabled field list
- `isAutoPopulationEnabled($module, $section)` - Check if enabled
- `extractFieldValue($shipment, $field, $module, $section)` - Smart extraction
- `getFieldMappings($module)` - Module-specific mappings

#### Files Modified:

2. **`app/Http/Controllers/InvoiceController.php`**
   - Added service import: `use App\Services\ShipmentMemoAutoPopulationService;`
   - Updated `generateFreightInvoice()` method
   - Auto-populated data applied to invoice fields:
     - `bill_to_name` → From customer/consignee (configured)
     - `consignor` → From shipper (configured)
     - `consignee` → From consignee (configured)
   - Passes `auto_populated` data to view

3. **`app/Http/Controllers/OceanImportController.php`**
   - Added service import
   - Updated `createInvoiceFromCharges()` method
   - Loads shipment with relationships
   - Returns auto-populated data in JSON response

4. **`app/Http/Controllers/OceanExportController.php`**

   - Integration for Air Import module

6. **`app/Http/Controllers/AirExportController.php`**
   - Added service import
   - Updated `createInvoiceFromCharges()` method
   - Integration for Air Export module

#### Field Mappings by Module:

**Ocean Export (6 Master + 8 House fields):**
- Master: oversea_agent, carrier, shipper, consignee, notify, sales
- House: mbl_shipper, mbl_consignee, mbl_notify, hbl_shipper, hbl_consignee, hbl_notify, delivery_agent, customer

**Ocean Import (7 Master + 7 House fields):**
- Master: oversea_agent, carrier, shipper, consignee, notify, delivery_agent, sales
- House: mbl_shipper, mbl_consignee, mbl_notify, hbl_shipper, hbl_consignee, hbl_notify, customer

**Air Export (6 Master + 8 House fields):**
- Master: oversea_agent, carrier, shipper, consignee, sales, agent
- House: mbl_shipper, mbl_consignee, mbl_notify, hbl_shipper, hbl_consignee, hbl_notify, co_loader, customer

**Air Import (7 Master + 6 House fields):**
- Master: oversea_agent, carrier, shipper, consignee, notify, delivery_agent, sales
- House: mbl_shipper, mbl_consignee, hbl_shipper, hbl_consignee, hbl_notify, customer

**Trucker (5 Master fields, no House B/L):**
- Master: customer, shipper, consignee, sales, trucker

**Misc (6 Master fields, no House B/L):**
- Master: customer, agent, shipper, consignee, sales, office

#### Auto-Population Logic:

**Smart Extraction:**
```php
// Example: Ocean Export Shipper field
'shipper' => 'dmShipper.name'  // Dot notation for relationships

// Example with callable for complex logic
'carrier' => function($s) {
    return is_object($s->carrier) ? $s->carrier->name : $s->carrier;
}

// Example with HBL fallback
'hbl_shipper' => function($s) {
    return $s->hbls->first()?->shipper ?? $s->dmShipper?->name;
}
```

**Priority System:**
1. Master B/L configured values (highest priority)
2. House B/L configured values
3. Default shipment values (fallback)

#### User Workflow (Complete):

**Step 1: Configure (One-time setup)**
1. Navigate to Settings → Trade Partner → Shipment Memo Auto-Load
2. Click module tab (e.g., Ocean Export)
3. Check desired fields:
   - ✅ Oversea Agent
   - ✅ Shipper
   - ✅ Consignee
   - ✅ Sales
4. Click Save → Configuration stored in database

**Step 2: Generate Invoice (Automatic)**
1. Go to Ocean Export → Edit Shipment
2. Click Charges tab
3. Click "Generate Freight Invoice" button
4. **System automatically:**
   - Reads configuration from database
   - Checks which fields are enabled
   - Extracts values from shipment data
   - Applies to invoice fields
5. Invoice opens with auto-populated fields
6. All configured fields show correct values

**Step 3: Verify**
- Bill To Name: Shows Customer/Consignee (from config)
- Consignor: Shows Shipper (from config)
- Consignee: Shows Consignee (from config)
- Sales Person: Shows Sales (from config)

#### Example Data Flow:

**Shipment Data:**
```
Ocean Export #12345
- Shipper: XYZ Exports Ltd. (dmShipper)
- Consignee: DEF Imports Inc. (dmConsignee)
- Oversea Agent: ABC Forwarding Co.
- Sales: John Smith
```

**Configuration (Enabled Fields):**
```
✅ oversea_agent
✅ shipper
✅ consignee
✅ sales
```

**When Invoice Generated:**
```php
// Service reads config and extracts:
$autoPopulatedData = [
    'oversea_agent' => 'ABC Forwarding Co.',
    'shipper' => 'XYZ Exports Ltd.',
    'consignee' => 'DEF Imports Inc.',
    'sales' => 'John Smith'
];

// Applied to invoice:
$billToNameFinal = 'DEF Imports Inc.';  // From consignee
$consignorFinal = 'XYZ Exports Ltd.';   // From shipper
$consigneeFinal = 'DEF Imports Inc.';   // From consignee
```

**Result:** Invoice displays all fields automatically! ✨

#### API Response Structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "invoice_no": "SCL00012345",
  "freight_invoice_url": "/shipments/ocean-export/12345/freight-invoice",
  "auto_populated_data": {
    "master_bl": {
      "oversea_agent": "ABC Forwarding Co.",
      "shipper": "XYZ Exports Ltd.",
      "consignee": "DEF Imports Inc.",
      "sales": "John Smith"
    },
    "house_bl": {
      "hbl_shipper": "Sub Shipper Inc.",
      "customer": "Customer Corp"

      "master_bl": ["oversea_agent", "shipper", "consignee", "sales"],
      "house_bl": ["hbl_shipper"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Error Handling:

✅ **Missing Configuration:** Returns empty array, uses defaults
✅ **Missing Shipment Data:** Returns null, falls back to existing values
✅ **Invalid Relationships:** Safe access with null coalescing (`??`)
✅ **Unknown Modules:** Returns empty array

#### Technical Features:

- ✅ **Dot Notation Access:** `forwardingAgent.name` extracts nested values

1. `app/Http/Requests/UpdateAirExportRequest.php` - Added 13 validation rules
2. `app/Http/Controllers/AirExportController.php` - Added 6 new methods
3. `routes/web.php` - Added 5 new API routes

**Lines of Code Added: ~150**
- Validation rules: ~15 lines
- Controller methods: ~120 lines
- Routes: ~15 lines

**Database Dependencies:**
- `activity_logs` table (for status logs)
- `documents` table (for file uploads)
- `air_exports` table (existing, with 13 new columns from previous migration)

**Storage Requirements:**
- Document uploads stored in: `storage/app/public/air-export-documents/`
- Directory structure: `{shipment_id}/{timestamp}_{original_filename}`
- Max file size: 10MB per file

### Next Steps (Frontend Implementation):

**Priority 1 - Status Tab:**
1. Add `statusLogs: []` to Alpine.js data
2. Create `loadStatusLogs()` method
3. Replace hardcoded HTML with `x-for` loop
4. Call API on tab activation

**Priority 2 - Doc Center Tab:**
1. Add `documents: []` to Alpine.js data
2. Create upload form with file input
3. Implement `uploadDocuments()`, `loadDocuments()`, `deleteDoc()` methods
4. Add document list table with download/delete buttons

**Priority 3 - Work Order Links:**
1. Search/replace `/ocean-export/work-order/` → `/air-export/work-order/`
2. Update `fetchWorkOrders()` API endpoint
3. Create air-export work order routes

**Priority 4 - Memo Verification:**
1. Verify existing memo routes work
2. Test `getMemos()`, `addMemo()`, `updateMemo()`, `deleteMemo()`
3. Ensure frontend properly calls endpoints

### Status: Backend Ready ✅

All backend APIs are implemented and ready for frontend integration. The controller methods follow the same patterns as Ocean Import/Export modules for consistency.

**Testing Checklist:**
- ✅ UpdateAirExportRequest validates 13 new fields
- ✅ Status logs API endpoint created
- ✅ Document upload/download/delete APIs created
- ✅ Invoice auto-population API created
- ✅ All routes registered in web.php
- ⚠️ Frontend integration pending (Status tab, Doc Center, Work Order)
